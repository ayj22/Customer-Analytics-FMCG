# Customer-Analytics-FMCG

In this project we have performed customer segmentation analytics. In this analysis we have segmented customer based on few factor such as sex, marital status, age of customer, level of education, income of the customer, occupation of customer and settlement size. 

Steps which we have followed are as follows:

1. Correlation Matrix: In this step we have found the correlation between the variables
2. As a part of analysis we hace visualised the relationship of different variables
3. Standardization: Standardization is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation.
4. In this step we have use hierarchical clustering used to group similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other. [1]
5. In the next step we have applied K-means clustering algorithm which is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). ... The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided[2]
